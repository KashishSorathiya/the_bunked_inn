  - Other roles receive `403 Forbidden`

### 2. **Hostel Application Controller**

- Fetch all pending hostel applications
- Approving an application triggers:

### 3. **Complaint Controller**
- Student can submit complaints
- Complaints retrieve with student details (`populate`)
- Admin can resolve complaints
- Complaints sorted by most recent first

### 4. **Room Change Controller**
- Student can submit a room change request
- Admin can approve or reject requests with reason
- When approved:
